# Project Overview
The automobile industry consists of cars belonging to different categories, each priced based on a combination of technical, performance, and design-related attributes. Car pricing is not influenced by a single factor; instead, it depends on multiple variables that may have direct or indirect effects on the final price.
This project focuses on understanding these relationships and building a predictive model that can accurately estimate the price of a car based on its characteristics.
# Problem Statement
Car prices vary significantly across different categories and models due to the influence of multiple numerical and categorical variables such as engine specifications, fuel efficiency, dimensions, and performance features. However, not all variables contribute equally to price determination, and some factors impact pricing indirectly.
The challenge is to analyze these variables, identify their influence on car pricing, and develop a predictive model capable of estimating car prices accurately for different car categories.
# Project Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to build a regression-based predictive model to estimate car prices using relevant features.
Specific objectives include:

Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of car prices and feature relationships.
Identifying variables that have a direct and indirect impact on car pricing.
Preprocessing and transforming data to make it suitable for modeling.
Building and evaluating multiple regression models.
Selecting the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.
Using the finalized model to predict car prices.
