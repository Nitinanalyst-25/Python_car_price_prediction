# Project Overview
The automobile industry consists of cars belonging to different categories, each priced based on a combination of technical, performance, and design-related attributes. Car pricing is influenced by multiple factors, and these factors may affect prices either directly or indirectly.

This project focuses on **exploring car price data**, understanding the relationships between different vehicle attributes and price, and applying basic regression techniques to learn how pricing patterns can be modeled using Python.

# Problem Statement
Car prices vary across different categories and models due to the influence of several numerical and categorical variables such as engine specifications, fuel efficiency, dimensions, and performance features. However, the contribution of each variable to the overall price is not always straightforward.

The objective is to analyze these variables, study their relationship with car prices, and apply regression techniques to understand how car prices can be modeled using historical data.

# Project Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis and apply basic regression models to understand car price behavior.

Specific objectives include:
- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to examine price distribution and feature relationships  
- Identifying variables that influence car prices directly or indirectly  
- Cleaning, preprocessing, and transforming data for analysis  
- Applying linear and polynomial regression to model car prices  
- Understanding how different regression techniques capture price trends in the data
